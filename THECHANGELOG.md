1.32.0;

Removed the Results Screen (Unused and broken in the latest versions.)

(!) The Note Color System has been upgraded to the 0.7.X system!! (YOU WILL NEED TO ENTER THE VISUALS & UI MENU TO RESET YOUR NOTESKIN AND SPLASH SKINS TO DEFAULT AS MOST OF THE OPTIONS YOU ALREADY USE HAVE BEEN REMOVED!) If you don't want to use the RGB Shaders the Classic noteskin is also available!

(almost) All of the num1 sprites (and their pixel variants) have been updated to their 0.3.X version
Botplay is now automatically enabled if you turn on Rendering Mode
Fixed a possible issue where if you went into another state or paused the game immediately after a big lag spike, a resync would trigger forcing the song to keep playing anyway (However an oversight from this is you have to wait slightly longer when unpausing before a song actually starts playing again. I will try to fix this in the future!)
Fixed Blammed Erect having the incorrect events
Fixed bf-christmas having funky offsets for the Left & Down animations
Fixed texts made using LUA going to camGame
Fixed vocal resync not working in EditorPlayState
